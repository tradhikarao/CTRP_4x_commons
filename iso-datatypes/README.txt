As of 2/1/2010 and version 2.0, the ISO 21090 Datatypes jar (iso-datatypes.jar) has been broken out from the CTRP/COPPA project and is now hosted on its own at https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/ISO21090/trunk/.  Tags for older versions (1.2.6 and earlier) can be found at https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/coppa/tags/.
