Steps to perform release:

1.  Make sure Jira is in order with all issues in the release you want to tag marked resolved and all other issues moved out of the release.
2.  Verify that the app passes all tests by running (you may need to run site verify in a separate step): mvn clean install site
3.  Use AHP (https://anthillpro3.nci.nih.gov/tasks/project/WorkflowTasks/viewDashboard?workflowId=4619) to perform a release.
4.  Mark the version released in Jira.
